# FIRE-GBCD Implementation

This project implements the FIRE (Fast Interpretable Rule Extraction) framework with a Greedy Block Coordinate Descent (GBCD) optimizer.

## Features
- Sparse rule extraction from decision tree ensembles
- Fusion penalty (Fused LASSO) for improved interpretability
- Parallel GBCD optimization for speed

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Activate the virtual environment.
3. Run experiments using `fire_experiments.ipynb`.
